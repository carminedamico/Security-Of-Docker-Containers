\section{Introduction}

Explain here why the XYZ protocol is important
and what was the purpose of the present work.

\section{State of the art}

In computer science, the term \textit{virtualisation} is referred to the 
creation of virtual computational resources. These resources, normally supplied 
as hardware, are provided instead to the user by the operating system through the 
creation of a new abstraction layer. OSs, storage devices or network resources 
could all be virtualised. Virtualisation can be obtained at different levels and 
using different techniques.
\par\textit{Virtual machines} have represented for many years the state of the art
of the virtualisation, being used in both consumer and enterprise contexts. In 
the last years a new technology, based on \textit{containers}, has started to 
gain more attention, thanks to its benefits. Docker is an open source container 
technology, stepped into the limelight thanks to its simple interface, which allows
to create and control containers. 

\subsection{From virtual machines...}

With the term virtual machines it is intended an hypervisor-based virtualisation,
that is a type of virtualisation that acts at hardware level. Virtual machines 
(VMs) are established on top of the host operating system, providing applications
with their dependencies, but also an entire guest OS and a separate kernel. 
\par
Hypervisors are distinguished in two different types, the ones that work 
directly on top of the host's hardware (bare metal hypervisors) and the ones 
that are on top host's OS (hosted hypervisors). The first type provides better 
performances, not having the overhead of the extra layer of the host's operating 
system. On the contrary the second type can be managed easier.

\section{Hardening Docker}

\section{Old}

Describe the protocol in detail, trying to demonstrate knowledge
of the topics covered in the course. In other words, don't limit
yourself just to list security features but explain why they are
important and provide your opinion if they are correctly implemented
or could be improved.

You can reference a figure by using the appropriate command,
as in the case of \myfig{\ref{fig:handshake}},
that will be automatically placed on the page and numbered by LaTeX.

You can also cite papers published at conferences, like \cite{move2008},
or journals \cite{dh} or an RFC \cite{gloss}.

If the section contains a lot of information, you may want to split it
into different subsections, each one with a specific focus as done here.

\subsection{Request format}
The request contains the ID of the caller and the destination IP address, encoded in four different bytes.

\subsection{Response format}
The response contains a status code (three digits encoded in ASCII)
followed by the answer encoded in ISO-8859-1 and terminate with CR LF.


\section{Experimental evaluation}
Describe:
\begin{itemize}
\item general purpose of the experiments (functional evaluation,
performance evaluation, comparison with other stuff)
\item experimental setup (hardware and software,
including detailed build and configuration instructions if needed)
\end{itemize}
Then describe each experiment: its specific purpose (\eg\ testing a specific
feature of the protocol), the command run, and the output (expected and actual).
You can use a table like \mytab{\ref{tab:results}} to group the results
(for example if the same experiment was repeated with several data sizes)
\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} % three centered columns (but you can also use 'r' for right or 'l' for left)
\hline
{\em data size} & {\em raw transfer time} & {\em secure transfer time} \\
(kB)            & (ms)                    & (ms)\\
\hline
128  & 20  & 22 \\
256  & 22  & 30 \\
512  & 26  & 37 \\
1024 & 30  & 99 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Experimental results.}
\label{tab:results}
\end{table}

For performance testing, remember to run not only experiments with various
data size but also -- in case of a client-server protocol -- stress tests
for the server (\ie\ increasing number of clients simultaneously requesting
attention from the server).
