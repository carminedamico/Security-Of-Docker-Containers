\section{State of the art}

In computer science, the term \textit{virtualisation} is referred to the
creation of virtual computational resources. These resources, normally supplied
as hardware, are instead provided to the user by the operating system through
the creation of a new abstraction layer. OSs, storage devices or network
resources could all be virtualised. Virtualisation can be obtained at different
levels and using different techniques. \par\textit{Virtual machines} have
represented for many years the state of the art of virtualisation, being used in
both consumer and enterprise contexts. In the last years a new technology, based
on \textit{containers}, has started to gain more attention, thanks to its
benefits. Docker is an open source container technology, stepped into the
limelight thanks to its simple interface, which allows to create and control
containers. 

\subsection{From virtual machines...}

With the term virtual machines it is often intended an \textbf{hypervisor-based
virtualisation}, that is a type of virtualisation that acts at hardware level.
Virtual machines (VMs) are established on top of the host operating system,
providing applications with their dependencies, but also an entire guest OS and
a separate kernel. One or more virtual machines can be run on the same machine.
Hypervisors are distinguished in two different types, the one that works
directly on top of the host's hardware (\textbf{bare metal hypervisor}) and the
one that is on top of the host's OS (\textbf{hosted hypervisor}). \par Bare
metal hypervisor provides better performances, not having the overhead of the
extra layer of the host's operating system. It manages directly hardware and the
guest's operating system. On the contrary hosted hypervisor can be manged in an
easier way, running as a normal computer program on the user's operating system.
\par As said before, the hypervisor needs to run on the user's computer, which
is defined as \textit{host machine}, while each virtual machines is called
\textit{guest machine}. It is important to remember this terminology, because it
will be used also in the following, referring to containers.

\subsection{...to containers}

\textbf{Container-based virtualisation} represents another approach to
virtualisation, mainly spread in the last years. Compared to hypervisor-based
virtualisation it results more lightweight, using the host's kernel to run
multiple virtual environments. It virtualises at operating system level (it is
also known as \textbf{OS-level virtualisation}), allowing other applications to
run without installing their own kernel on the host. Containers look like
separated process that just share host's kernel. \par Resources are provided by
the host's OS, together with the container engine. A container engine is the
technology in charge of create and manage containers. \textbf{Docker} represents
one of the most important and most used container engine. A computer program
running into a container can only see the resources allocated to that particular
container. On the same host there could be more than one container, each one
with its personal set of dedicated resources. Although it could be possible to
run more than one computer program inside the same container, it is always
suggested to run only one program per container, in order to separate areas of
concern. It is better to connect multiple containers using user-defined networks
and shared volumes. \par There are many representatives of this container-based
virtualisation approach, like \textit{Linux-VServer}, \textit{OpenVZ} and
\textit{LinuX Container (LXC)}. This last will be better described in the next
section, allowing to better understand the behaviour of containers.

\subsection{LXC}

\textbf{LinuX Containers}, better known as LXC, are an OS-level virtualisation
technique created around 2008. They allow to run multiple isolated Linux
instances (the \textit{containers}), on top of a single host \textit{LXC host},
which shares its Linux kernel. Each container \textit{sees} its own CPU, memory,
network interface, I/O, ecc... \par The isolation among containers is obtained
thanks to some Linux kernel's tools: namespace and cgroups. In the following
subsections these two components will be analysed, both for their importance for
containerisation in general and for the fact that they are also the basic
components in Docker.

\subsubsection{Kernel namespace}

\textbf{Namespaces} allow to create isolated environments, in which each process
that belongs to that particular environment can see global host's resources as
personal isolated resources. In other words they allow to create pool of
processes that think to be the only ones of the system. In this way groups of
processes, that are part of different namespaces, can see different set of
resources. Namespaces work by assigning to different resources the same name in
different namespaces. In the Linux kernel six different type of environments are
implemented:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item PID Namespace
    \item IPC Namespace
    \item UTS Namespace
    \item Network Namespace
    \item User Namespace
    \item Mount Namespace
  \end{enumerate} 

\subsubsection{Cgroups}

\textbf{Cgroups} are a kernel tool used to manage processes' resources. They
gather, track and limit processes' usage of resources. It is possible to create
and manage \textit{cgroups} using high level code, assigning PID to a specific
\textit{cgroup}. They represent the fundamental tool to obtain resource
isolation, playing an important role also for the CPU and I/O's scheduling.
